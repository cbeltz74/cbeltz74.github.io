            <p>Each time, <span class="big">I am disappointed.</span></p>
            <p>I went to bed I hoping I would <span class="bigger">never open my eyes again.</span></p>
            <p>So now I have to get through today.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">During the day</h2>
            <p>On workdays, I cannot wait until the day is over. My job is to help people.</p>
            <p>But I feel like I should be working on my own issues. <span class="big">But I don't know how.</span></p>
            <p>All I am told is just go get a new job. Apparently this is easy.</p>
        
            <p>My dream is to be a developer. It does not have a date, so it cannot be a goal yet. Techically it has a year, but that was 2005.</p>
            <p>I've built a few websites here and there over the past many years I have had this dream.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Form for taxpayers to get more information about their return.</li>
                <li>A site dedicated to 61 of the best players to play for the Twins to appear on Topps baseball cards since 1961.</li>
                <li>My favorite recent website was to showcase some of my baesball card collection. It eventually featured rookie cards that I have collected of the Top 100 Players in Major League Baseball.</li>
                <li>I also tried to recreate a scientific calculator, but that failed.</li>
                <li>I've also bought a ton of tutorial videos and books but have not finished any of them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I haven't showed them to many people. They get rejected and so I get dejected and stop coding.</p>
            <p>Eventually I start again, but have lost the momentum I once had.</p>     
            <p>Hopefully, tomorrow will be different. <span class="bigger">Hopefully, there won't be one.</span></p>
