    <h2 class="headline">When I wake up in the morning</h2>
    <p>Each morning I wake up, I am disappointed.</p>
    <p>I went to bed I hoping I would never wake up.</p>
    <p>So now I have to get through today.</p>

    <h2 class="headline">During the day</h2>
    <p>On workdays, I cannot wait until the day is over. My job is to help people.</p>
    <p>But I feel like I should be working on my own issues. But I don't know how.</p>
    <p>All I hear is just go get a new job. Apparently this is easy.</p>

    <h2 class="headline">At night</h2>
    <p>My dream is to be a developer. It does not have a date, so it cannot be a goal yet.</p>
    <p>I've built a few websites here and there over the past many years I have had this dream.</p>
    <p>I haven't showed them to many people. They get rejected and so I get dejected and stop coding.</p>
    <p>Eventually I start again, but have lost the momentum I once had.</p> 
    <p>Hopefully, tomorrow will be different. Hopefully, there won't be one.</p>
