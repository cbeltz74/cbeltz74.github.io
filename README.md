Colin's website on GitHub.

This site is one of the results of hte Frontend Masters Bootcamp that I took in April 2020.
It involved creating a website that included topics covered in class such as HTML, CSS, Javascript
as well as different ways to create interactive sites such as a photo gallery and choosing a dog picture based on the breed.
