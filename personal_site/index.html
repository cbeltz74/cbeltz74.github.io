    <h1>Hello, my name is Mud</h1>
    <h2>I am trying to become a web developer but I keep getting in my own way.</h2>
    <p>I keep trying to remind myself I have built a few neat things.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Form for taxpayers to get more information about their return.</li>
        <li>A site dedicated to sixty of the best players to play for the Twins to appear on Topps baseball cards since 1961.</li>
        <li>My favorite recent website was to showcase some of my baesball card collection. It eventually featured rookie cards that I have collected of the Top 100 Players in Major League Baseball.</li>
        <li>I also tried to recreate a scientific calculator, but that failed.</li>
        <li>I've also bought a ton of tutorials and books but have not finished any of them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My problem is that I give up too easy.</p>
