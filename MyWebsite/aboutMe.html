    <p>My name is Colin Beltz and I live in Eagan, Minnesota. I currently work in Customer Service for the State of Minnesota.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know?</p>
        <cite>Ernest Hemmingway</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>My goal is to begin working in web development because I would like to get back to creating projects with a group as well as on my own.</p>

    <p>I used to work in the newspaper industry. At some point during my career, I conducted interviews, wrote stories, shot and edited photographs, edited copy and designed news pages in advance as well as on deadline.</p>

    <p>Three important things to know about me:</p>

    <ul class="important">
        <li>I enjoy collaborating with others.</li>
        <li>I may be quiet, but that does not mean I don't have good ideas.</li>
        <li>Working hard does not that it can't be fun.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of my favorite websites to visit is <a href="http://www.twinsdaily">Twins Daily</a>. I enjoy following the Twins and it is a great source for news and stories about the team.</p>
