                <p>I created a web form that would allow taxpayers to get additional information about their tax returns. </p> 
                <p>The idea around the form was to provide additional assistance when our phones were busy during the day or for the taxpayer to get additional information when our office was closed. By answering six questions, the user gets some general information about their return.</p>

                            During the pandemic, I began collecting baseball cards again. The hobby has provided enjoyment as well as sparked ideas on how to display my collection online.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is an ongoing project that has taken a lot of time and energy. This project utilizes a MySQL database to store player and card information and as well as photos of the front of each card. I am using PHP to get the data from the database and display it on the webpage.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As of now, each page shows the result for one year and one list source. The goal is to create a form allowing users to find cards in a variety of ways including by name, year as well as type of card.

                            Collecting cards again provided another idea. I was also looking for ways to enjoy the hobby withoout spending a lot of money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This idea was to determine the top 60 or so players in Minnesota Twins history. Topps has produced cards since the club's first season in 1961. After narrowing the list of players, my goal was to find the card whose back included the most years with the Twins.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As far as presenting the cards online, I chose to display both the front and the back of the card as well as the year in which the card was produced. It remains a work in progress.

                               A co-worker told me about micro-sites. The idea is a website that does one small thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was looking for some inspiration on what to create and came up with the idea of a site to tell the user whether it is payday. The user enters a recent paydate and how often they receive their paycheck. Then using Javascript, the next paydate is shown to the user along with a witty message, picture or video in response.
                            </p>
    
                            <p>
                               I am in the early stages of creating this site. I am still looking for how to grab the date from the date picker. I think the rest will follow pretty quickly as I think it is pretty similar to my taxpayer form.
