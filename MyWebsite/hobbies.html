    <h1>My hobby is collecting baseball cards</h1>

    <p>I enjoyed collecting baseball cards as a teenager but slowly gave it up after starting college and a career.</p>

    <p>For the past several years, I would buy a pack of Topps baseball cards at the start of the season or when I noticed they were on sale.</p>

    <p>It was more of a way to see what the design looked like each year as I did not pay attention to anything happening with cards at the time.</p>
    
    <p>In the past few years or so, I've started to collect again. For a while, the Minnesota Twins were not playing good baseball. But they had some prospects that everyone was excited about. That got me more interested in baseball in general.</p>

    <p>It began with buying packs more often to see what players I could get and then grew into wanting to track down autographed cards of some of the up and coming Twins players.</p>
        
    <p>I started checking eBay and for area card shops and shows around the area.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to today and I now have quite a few different collections and other collectibles that I enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Some of the highlights are:</h2>

            <h3>Twins Stadium Club sets</h3>
            <img src="/images/vertical.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>Topps began producing Stadium Club in 1991. The cards were considered high-end at that time and the photography was a major selling point of the set. The company continued to produce cards until 2008.</p> 
            <p>The company began producing them again in 2014 and have continued ever since. I have every Stadium Club Twins team set including some autographs, inserts and some photo variations.</p>

            <h3>Twins Bowman Chrome prospects</h3>
            <img src="/images/horizontal.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>Since Topps began producing cards under the Bowman name in 1989, the brand has been synonymous with rookie cards. The 1st Bowman of prospects is always highly sought after. There are regular base cards (paper) and Bowman Chrome cards. </p> 
            <p>The most-sought after cards are the colorful variations with autographs on them. I've been collecting Twins Bowman Chrome Prospects with autographs going back to the 2016 set until today. I didn't start collecting these until last August. The only autographs I am missing since 2016 are Alex Kirilloff, Royce Lewis and Luis Arraez.</p>

            <h3>One Topps Card per Twins Season</h3>
            <img src="/images/vertical.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>While trying to find something to collect, I had the idea of getting one card from the Topps flagship series for each year the Twins have been in existance. The other part of the collections is that I wanted to find the best players the Twins have ever had. It was fun trying to coordinate what players to get but also what years they played. The last part of the goal was to get a card which showed as many years with the team as possible to show why he was one of the team's best players.</p>

            <h3>Twins Yearbooks</h3>
            <img src="/images/horizontal.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>My Dad had kept some of his Twins yearbooks from the 1960s. One of my favorite memories as a kid is my family and I went to a Twins game around my birthday each yar. We picked up yearbooks then as well.</p>
            <p>Recently, I started trying to find the ones we were missing. At this time, I am only missing the years of 1983, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1998. If you have any of these years and are interesting in selling them, contact me. In addition, I have World Series programs from 1965, 1987 and 1991. I also have All Star Game programs from 1965, 1985 and 2014 when the game was played in Minnesota.</p>

            <h3>World Series Press Pins</h3>
            <img src="/images/vertical.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>Dating back to the earliest World Series, each team would hand out a press pin to members of the press covering the team.</p>
            <p>My career started in newspapers so I have always been facinated by them. I found the Twins World Series Press Pins from 1987 and 1991. They also have a 1965 pin that I don't have yet.</p>

            <h3>All Star Game Press Pin</h3>
            <img src="/images/horizontal.jpeg" class="highlights_image">
            <p>Similar to World Series, All Star Game Press Pins have also been created. Right now, I have the pin from the 2014 All Star Game at Target Field. The Twins also played host to the All Star Game in 1985 and 1965.</p>
