    <h1>My hobby is collecting baseball cards</h1>

    <p>I enjoyed collecting baseball cards as a teenager but slowly gave it up after starting college and a career.</p>

    <p>For the past several years, I would buy a pack of Topps baseball cards at the start of the season or when I noticed they were on sale.</p>

    <p>It was more of a way to see what the design looked like each year as I did not pay attention to anything happening with cards at the time.</p>
    
    <p>In the past few years or so, I've started to collect again. For a while, the Minnesota Twins were not playing good baseball. But they had some prospects that everyone was excited about. That got me more interested in baseball in general.</p>

    <p>It began with buying packs more often to see what players I could get and then grew into wanting to track down autographed cards of some of the up and coming Twins players.</p>
        
    <p>I started checking eBay and for area card shops and shows around the area.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to today and I now have quite a few different collections and other collectibles that I enjoy.</p>

    <h2>Some of the highlights are:</h2>

    <ul class="highlights">
        <li>Every Topps Stadium Club Twins team set including some autographs, inserts and photo variations.</li>
        <li>Twins Bowman Chrome Prospects with autographs from 2016 to today. I didn't start collecting these until last August. The only autographs I am missing since 2016 are Alex Kirilloff, Royce Lewis and Luis Arraez.</li>
        <li>One Topps card for each year the Twins organization has existed.</li>
        <li>Twins yearbooks. I am only missing the years of 1983, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1998. If you have any of these years and are interesting in selling them, contact me.</li>
        <li>Twins World Series Press Pins from 1987 and 1991.</li>
        <li>All Star Game Press Pin from 2014 at Target Field.</li>
     </ul>
