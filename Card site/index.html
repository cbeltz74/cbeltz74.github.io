                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to my card collection site. I recently returned to the hobby in 2017 just in time to pick up some 2017 Topps Series 2, Update and Holiday packs. Considering what has happened since that time, I am glad to have come back in when I did.</p>
                    <p>My collecting habits have changed quite a bit since re-entry. I started just buying what I found on the shelves and reading as much as I could on CardboardConnection.com and Beckett.com and attending a monthly show nearby. I soon discovered card collecting had changed quite a bit since the early 1990s.</p>
                    <p>I thought it would be simpler since I focused only on baseball and just Topps was producing cards for the most part. That was hardly the case.</p>
                    <p>At first I focused on collecting cards of the Minnesota Twins and especially years that I was out of the hobby. That soon morphed into getting autographs of current stars, Stadium Club cards and team yearbooks and programs.</p>
                    <p>I also used to work as a sportswriter, so press pins have always interested me as well.</p>
                    <p>After reading Top 100 player lists, I made a goal to get as many different cards of Top 100 players for 2019 that I could The goal was to have 100 different designs. It is still a work in progress.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I decided to track down the base Topps rookie cards of all Top 100 players. For 2020 and 2021, I am only missing the 2011 Topps Update Mike Trout.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am prospecting for rookies in every way I can think of to find the next breakout star.</p>
                    <p>Thanks for looking and happy collecting!</p>
